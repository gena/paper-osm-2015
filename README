This repository provides material used for the paper: <add a link here>

Overview
========

The repository contains scripts and Python Notebooks which can be used to perform a comparison of 

  1) Raster water masks derived from Landsat satellite imagery
  2) Vector datasets representing hydrography (OpenStreetMap or Surface Hydrology for Australia)
  3) Drainage networks derived from 30m SRTM

Some of the scripts make use of Google Earth Engine (GEE).

Some of the scripts require https://github.com/gena/ee-runner to run GEE JavaScript API in a command-line.
